# Script Variation Generator - Usage Guide

## What This Skill Does

This skill generates **3 distinct, high-quality variations** of YouTube content based on your proven frameworks and past work. It can create:

2. **Title/idea variations** (different angles for the same video concept)
3. **Complete script variations** (full YouTube scripts with different strategic approaches)

## How It Works

The skill automatically:
- **Searches your past conversations** to understand your recent work and current themes
- **References your project knowledge** (Kallaway frameworks, Bryan Ng strategies, your credibility markers)
- **Maintains your brand voice** (business automation focus, ROI calculations, authority positioning)
- **Generates strategic variations** (each tests a different angle, not just word swaps)
